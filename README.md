# Providing-Data-Driven-Suggestion-for-HR-Python

In this project, I use PACE to help Salifort Motors which is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, improve employee satisfaction levels.

PACE is a framework developed at Google to lay a foundation upon which data analysts will develop their own workflow practices. The PACE framework helps data analysts solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently.
